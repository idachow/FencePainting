Processing &amp; OpenCV &amp; Minim -- Site-specific projection installation on The Fence  (@ Carnegie Mellon)
=============

Video of installation: http://vimeo.com/109515908
=============

This installation & projection piece plays with the tension between digital and traditional mediums, and makes the inanimate fence dynamic and responsive to the level of activity around it making it almost a transient portrait of the people that pass by.

It also plays off the tradition of painting The Fence @ CMU (The Fence is the most painted object in the world) and has a strict set of rules that state that The Fence can only painted after midnight for a certain period of time -- this installation also plays with the rules by quickly and temporarily "painting" the fence without any physical work.
=============

// "Face Painting"
// Projection/installation project

// Requires openCV, minim, fisica 
// All available as libraries in Processing.


// READ-ME
// Volume changes color of the fisica balls
// <space> changes color of the face tracking
// face tracking from webcam is flipped to be more intuitive for projection
// Fisica balls will eventually turn one color with no activity
// Face tracking rectangles will disappear with no activity
// (Sound changes opacity of face tracking, so visible with activity)

// Wow! Fun! Let's go face painting!
